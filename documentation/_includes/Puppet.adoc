= Introduction to Puppet

Puppet is a tool used to apply and manage system configurations. Puppet collects system information (or facts) and uses this information to create a customized system configurations.  

Puppet uses it's own  configuration language that was inspired by the Nagios configurationl file format.  Puppet code is written to create a 'Puppet Manifest'.  Manifests are then assembled together into a more structured unit called a 'Puppet Module'.

'Puppet Modules' are a collection manifests along with additional data such as facts, files, and templates.

== Puppet Overview

So a high-level work flow summary goes like this:

  * you create a collection of manifests
  * you (potentially) also create a collection of facts, files and templates
  * you assemble these components into a module
  * you install the module on the 'puppet server', which in our case is the satellite server
 
Then:

  * on the client, a 'puppet agent' collects facts about the system and sends it to the 'puppet master'
  * on the client, the 'puppet agent' retrieves the applicable modules designated for the client and applies them to the system
  * and finally, the 'puppet agent' sends a report of applied changes and their success status to the 'puppet master'
  
Our goal in this exercise is to configure a client as simple LAMP based server.

== Create a Puppet Module

=== Initialize the Module

For purposes of this workshop, we are going to due to puppet module work on the satellite server itself.  This is simply due to the fact that all of the tools are already installed.

[root@satellite]
----
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules
puppet module generate student-examplecom
----

=== Create Manifests

[/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/examplecom/manifests/lamp_pkgs.pp]
----
class examplecom::lamp_pkgs {
  ## example of specifying multiple packages at once
  
  package { [ 'httpd', 'php', 'mysql-server' ]: ensure => installed }
  
  ## exmaple of individual package declarations
  
  package { 'vim': ensure => installed }
  package { 'basch-completion': ensure => installed }
  
  ## enable and start the httpd service
  service { 'httpd': ensure => running, enable => true, require => package['httpd'] }
}
----

[/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/examplecom/manifests/init.pp]
----
class examplecom {
  include examplecom::lamp_pkgs
}
----

=== Test the Puppet Module

----
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules
puppet apply examplecom/manifests/init.pp --noop
----

=== Build the Puppet Module

----
cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules
puppet module build examplecom
----

== Add Puppet Module to Satellite

=== Create a Custom Product

==== Add Puppet Repository

==== Upload Puppet Module

=== Update the Content View

Content -> Content Views

Select our Content View

Select TAB:Puppet Modules

Select 'Add New Module'

Add all Manifests from our custom Module

=== Publish Content View

=== Promote Content View

== Add Puppet Environment to Host Group

== Add Puppet Modules to Host Group

== APPENDIX

=== Sample Manifest: Install Packages

This uses existing configured repos to install additional packages

----
class examplecom::default_pkgs {
  package { [ 'bash-completion', 'net-tools', 'screen', 'vim' ]: ensure => installed }
  package { 'firefox': ensure => installed }
  package { 'thunderbird': ensure => installed }
  package { 'libreoffice': ensure => installed }
}
----

=== Sample Manifest: Chrome Repo

This manifest configures an external repo and installs Google Chrome

----
class examplecom::google_chrome {
  yumrepo { 'google-chrome' :
    enabled  => 1,
    descr    => 'google-chrome',
    baseurl  => 'http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/rpm/stable/x86_64',
    gpgcheck => 1,
    gpgkey   => 'https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub',
  }
  package { ['google-chrome-stable','redhat-lsb-core'] : ensure => installed }

}
----

=== Sample Manifest: Adobe Flash

This manifest configures an external repo and installs Adobe Flash

----
class examplecom::adobe_flash {
  package { 'adobe-release-x86_64' :
    ensure   => 'present',
    source   => 'http://linuxdownload.adobe.com/adobe-release/adobe-release-x86_64-1.0-1.noarch.rpm'
  }
  package { 'flash-plugin' : ensure   => installed }
}
----

=== Sample Manifest: Install file

This manifest installs a file (if it does not exist already).  The file is pulled from a remote server.

----
class examplecom::libvirt {
  file { '/var/lib/libvirt/iso/' : ensure => directory }
  file { '/var/lib/libvirt/iso/ExampleCom-Discovery-Image.iso' : 
    ensure => file,
    source => 'http://satellite.example.com/pub/Discovery-Images/ExampleCom-Discovery-Image.iso',
  }
}
